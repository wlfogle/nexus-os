## 🚨 **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

### **Potential Risks**:
1. **Package Conflicts**: Universal package manager conflicts with pacman/yay
2. **Performance Degradation**: Additional services impact gaming performance
3. **System Instability**: Docker containers affect system stability
4. **Resource Usage**: Media stack consumes too much RAM/CPU
5. **Integration Issues**: AI services don't integrate properly

### **Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Sandboxed Package Manager**: nexuspkg operates in isolation from base system
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking vs baseline
3. **Gradual Deployment**: Deploy services incrementally with testing
4. **Resource Limits**: Docker containers have CPU/memory limits
5. **Rollback Capability**: Easy rollback to base Garuda configuration

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Documentation**

1. **Commit Documentation**: Push roadmap and implementation plan to git
2. **Environment Setup**: Create /opt/nexusos structure and build environment  
3. **Package Manager**: Compile and test nexuspkg universal package manager
4. **AI Orchestrator**: Deploy service coordination system
5. **Media Stack**: Deploy and configure 65+ media services

**Let's start building the future of Linux desktop computing! 🚀**
