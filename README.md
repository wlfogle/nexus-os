## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Kernel Compilation Issues
```bash
# Check system resources
free -h
nproc

# Clean build if needed
cd ~/kernel-build/linux-stable
make mrproper
```

### Ollama Performance Issues
```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status ollama

# Monitor resources
./monitor-llm-performance.sh

# Restart with debug
sudo systemctl restart ollama
journalctl -fu ollama
```

### Memory Issues with Large Models
```bash
# Check huge pages
cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i huge

# Adjust model quantization
./manage-llm-models.sh list-sizes
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust for Different RAM Sizes
Edit the memory calculations in `optimize-ollama-system.sh`:
```bash
# For 32GB systems
HUGEPAGE_SIZE_GB=$((TOTAL_MEMORY_GB * 30 / 100))

# For 128GB systems
HUGEPAGE_SIZE_GB=$((TOTAL_MEMORY_GB * 50 / 100))
```

### Different CPU Models
Modify the CPU-specific optimizations in `compile-custom-kernel.sh`:
```bash
# For AMD systems
CONFIG_X86_AMD_PSTATE=y
# CONFIG_X86_INTEL_PSTATE is not set
```

## 📈 Benchmarking

### System Performance
```bash
# Run kernel benchmark
./benchmark-custom-kernel.sh

# LLM-specific benchmarks
./manage-llm-models.sh benchmark
```

### Expected Results (i9-13900HX)
- **CPU Performance**: 95%+ efficiency across all cores
- **Memory Bandwidth**: 60GB/s+ with optimizations
- **NVMe Performance**: 7GB/s+ sequential, 1M+ IOPS random
