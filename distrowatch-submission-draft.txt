Brief Description:

NexusOS is the world's first truly universal Linux distribution that can natively install packages from ANY Linux distribution. Built on the solid foundation of Garuda Dr460nized Gaming Edition, NexusOS breaks down barriers by supporting DEB, RPM, ZST, Flatpak, Snap, AppImage, Python, NPM, Cargo, and Docker packages through a single unified interface while maintaining all the gaming optimizations and performance benefits of Garuda Linux.

The distribution features an AI-native architecture with two specialized AI assistants: "Stella" (Golden Retriever mascot) for security monitoring and package management, and "Max Jr." (Cat mascot) for performance optimization and system monitoring. These AI companions provide intelligent system management, automatic optimization, and seamless integration across all system functions.

NexusOS includes a complete self-hosting infrastructure stack with 100+ ready-to-deploy services including media servers (Plex, Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr), home automation (Home Assistant), development tools (GitLab, Jenkins), and monitoring solutions (Grafana, Prometheus).
