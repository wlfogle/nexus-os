### 🔴 **Implementation Gaps (What's Missing)**
- **🏗️ Build System** - No actual ISO creation or build pipeline
- **⚙️ Compiled Binaries** - QML/C++ code exists but not compiled/executable
- **📦 Working Package Manager** - nexuspkg exists as C code but not built/tested
- **🖥️ Desktop Environment Runtime** - NexusDE components need compilation
- **🎯 Live Testing Environment** - No way to boot and test the system
- **📋 Hardware Testing** - Unvalidated on real hardware configurations
